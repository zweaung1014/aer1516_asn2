Problem Statement
--------------------
Implement the planning algorithm called Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees* (RRT*)
for the problem setup provided by the RRT_dubins_problem class.

INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
1. The only file to be submitted is this file: rrt_star_planner.py. Your
   implementation can be tested by running dubins_path_problem.py (check the
   main function).
2. Read all class and function documentation in dubins_path_problem.py carefully.
   There are plenty of helper functions in the class to ease implementation.
3. Your solution must meet all the conditions specified below.
4. Below are some DOs and DONTs for this problem.

Conditions
-------------------
There are several conditions that must be satisfied for an acceptable solution.
These may or may not be verified by the auto-grading script.

1. The solution loop must not run for more than a certain number of random iterations
   (specified by the class member max_iter). This is mainly a safety
   measure to avoid time-out-related issues and will be set generously.
2. The planning function must return a list of nodes that represent a collision-free path
   from the start node to the goal node. The path states (path_x, path_y, path_yaw)
   specified by each node must define a Dubins-style path and traverse from node i-1 -> node i.
   (READ the documentation for the Node class to understand the terminology).
3. The returned path should have the start node at index 0 and the goal node at index -1.
   The parent node for node i from the list should be node i-1 from the list (i.e.,
   the path should be a valid, continuous list of connected nodes).
4. The node locations must not lie outside the map boundaries specified by
   RRT_dubins_problem.map_area.

DOs and DONTs
-------------------
1. DO NOT rename the file rrt_star_planner.py for submission.
2. DO NOT change the rrt_star_planner function signature.
3. DO NOT import anything other than what is already imported in this file.
4. YOU MAY write additional helper functions in this file to reduce code repetition,
   but these functions can only be used inside the rrt_star_planner function
   (since only the rrt_star_planner function will be imported for grading).

    Execute RRT* planning using Dubins-style paths. Make sure to populate the node_list.

    Inputs
    -------------
    rrt_dubins  - (RRT_dubins_problem) Class containing the planning
                  problem specification.
    display_map - (boolean) Flag for animation on or off (OPTIONAL).

    Outputs
    --------------
    (list of Node) This must be a valid list of connected nodes that form
                   a continuous path from the start node to the goal node.

    NOTE: In order for the rrt_dubins.draw_graph function to work properly, it is
    important to populate rrt_dubins.node_list with all valid RRT nodes.
